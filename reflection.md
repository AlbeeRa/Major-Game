## Answer questions like the following: what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
- Stick to Matter.js. Matter.js overall had better explanation and alot of help and tutorial all over the internet. If I knew that from the start that would've saved atleast 1 week worth of research on P5play. Dont be scared because it's a Major project. I feel like that one of the reason that led me to procastinating, I was to scared of getting stuck on the same thing everyday. If one thing stops working try another way, or if buttons stops working, just start working on something else in the project. But keep working.
Also If I continue this project in the future, I would probably like to add more levels and enemies.

## Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
- I have Completed everything on my 'needs to have' expect collision. The 'likes to have' I have finished is cat avatars.
##What was the hardest part of the project?
- deleting objects when I want to retry.
- Picking which library to work with.
- Collision detection between the enemy and player.

## Were there any problems you could not solve?
- I couldn't solve how to get the collision between the object. I tried out the alienX and Catx but it wasn't working because alien kept moving. And I added a counter to it to find the points, but the counter kept going up after launching (it was giving numbers like 2000 or just adding more than 1 when i was writing down coinCounter++)

## One thing I am proud of?
- That I was able to understand Matter.js and deleting objects.
