## Eesha (CS person)
- aesthetically pleasing
- would've liked the game to start after selecting the character instead of selecting and having to press shift again
- the draw back on the sling is too much, you can hit the blocks and enemies without launching the character
- music is fitting
## Pieta (Non CS person)
- The character's are cool and fun to choose. The background of the game is really cool. Reminds me of angry birds.
